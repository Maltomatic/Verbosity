So,
death and life. Different sides, one coin
Well.
Unrelentingly we trudge,
    steps fall upon Earth, lightly
    unrelentingly, we trudge
        Eternity. Eventually. Passing.
Darkly, the skies rise
Onwards!
Brightly, our hearts burn; a sun against the night
    Earth, thusly quivering...
It's though:
    A--
    Strength, it keeps ever growing, endlessly;
        Rising, just like the Phoenix glides; and
        obstacles.
    Be-gone, then!

Accept this:
time some day will waste all men of this here land
Fear none:
Legacies persist eternally.
    Forever existing
Mankind may expire,
--man inevitably long have expired
Stories
    Persist still
